I am Furkan, a Ph.D. student and a research fellow at <a href= "https://www.philol.uni-leipzig.de/en/research-training-group-interaction-of-grammatical-building-blocks"	 target ="_blank">IGRA</a>.
I am currently interested in optionality/variation in different language components. Using Harmonic Grammar, I argue that the same mechanism is behind deriving optionality/variation in phonology, morphology, and syntax.
I am also interested in psycholinguistics, data analysis, and corpora. Personally, I like to play sandbox video games and take pictures.

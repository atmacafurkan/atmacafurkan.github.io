I am a Ph.D. student and a research fellow at [IGRA](https://www.philol.uni-leipzig.de/en/research-training-group-interaction-of-grammatical-building-blocks) in Leipzig.
I am currently interested in optionality/variation in different language components. I mostly argue that all language components use the same mechanism to derive optionality/variation.
I am also interested in psycholinguistic experiments, data analysis, and corpora. Personally, I like to play sandbox video games and take pictures.
